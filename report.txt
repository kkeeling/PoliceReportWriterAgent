**Summary of Incident:**

On August 10, 2023, at approximately 06:56 hours, the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre (TBRHSC) received a report from Matthew Padezka, a male complainant, stating that he was stabbed and in the vicinity behind the landmark at 10 Dossen Road. The Communications Department initially dispatched Constable Gerald F. E. Madge, R. E. C. II, and Constable Justin Richard, Baj, to the area.

Upon investigation, it was discovered that Matthew Padezka was actually located at his residence, 704 McLaughlin Street, and not near the landmark as initially reported. A cell phone ping confirmed his location.

Officer Duffing and Cherk arrived at the scene and spoke with Darell Garell, a resident of 706 McLaughlin Street, who had no knowledge of Matthew Padezka. Officers then proceeded to 704 McLaughlin Street, where they found Matthew Padezka intoxicated and admitted to consuming alcohol earlier that morning.

Matthew Padezka explained that the initial report was a joke intended for his TikTok video and apologized for the false information. He stated that he had already deleted the video from his social media feed. No injuries or medical attention were required, and Matthew Padezka was advised that he could face criminal charges of public mischief.

Using officer discretion, Constable Duffy decided not to lay criminal charges against Matthew Padezka, and this report is filed solely for documentation purposes.
